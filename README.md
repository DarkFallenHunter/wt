Like Geralt of Rivia said:
>Evil is evil, Stregobor. Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I’m not a pious hermit. I haven't done only good in my life. But if I’m to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.

`cout << "std::Hello, World!";`

```C++
void hello()
{
 std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```
